## Data Structure

### Classification of Data Structure

![classification-of-dsa](resources/classification-dsa.png)

#### Linear Data Structure

> - Data Structure in which data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly.
> - If the element is attached to its previous and next one, it is the linear data structure.

##### Static Data Structure

> - Static Data Structure has a fixed memory size and structure in compile time.
> - The content of this structure can be modified without changing the memory space allocated to it.

##### Dynamic Data Structure

> - Dynamic Data Structure has a variable size and structure at runtime.
> - It can be modified and resized during runtime.

#### Non-linear Data Structure

> Data Structure in which data elements are not arranged sequentially or linearly.
